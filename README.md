# MEAM520 Final Project

Fall 2020, Taught by Prof. Cynthia Sung

Brian Grimaldi, Venkata Gurrala, Sheil Sarda, Alexis Ward

### Overview

Teams will use the concepts learned during the semester to control their simulated Lynx robot in a
head-to-head competition with their opponents’ robot. The robots will manipulate objects in the simulated
environment to score points, culminating in a class-wide tournament.
